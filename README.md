# GIF Creator

This Python script creates a GIF from a given folder containing images. It uses the `imageio` library to read images and create a GIF.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `imageio` library (install via `pip install imageio`)

## Usage

1. Place your images in a folder.
2. Update the `image_folder` variable in the script to point to your image folder.
3. Run the script.
4. The GIF will be saved as `output.gif` in the same directory as the script.

## Customization

- You can adjust the duration of each frame in the GIF by changing the `duration` parameter in the script.

## Example

```bash
python Main.py
```
